This is a 3D Editor developed by Apetrei Ionuț and Vasilache Ștefan, designed for viewing and editing 3D objects in a three-dimensional space.

Users can view, edit, and save objects in standard 3D file formats (.obj), as well as in an custom .tri format, create new objects, and visualize them in a 3D environment.

The project is developed in C++ using the WinBGIm Graphics Library.
